Check if you need a visa to enter the UK. Citizens from many countries can visit for up to 6 months without a visa, but requirements vary by nationality. Always verify the latest requirements on the UK government website.

### Best Time to Visit

The UK can be visited year-round, but each season offers unique experiences:

- Spring (March-May): Mild weather and blooming gardens
- Summer (June-August): Warmest weather, longest days, but most crowded
- Autumn (September-November): Beautiful foliage and fewer tourists
- Winter (December-February): Christmas markets and festive atmosphere

## Essential Destinations

### London

The capital city is a must-visit with iconic landmarks like Big Ben, the Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace. Don't miss world-class museums like the British Museum and National Gallery, which offer free entry.

### Edinburgh

Scotland's capital combines medieval and Georgian architecture. Visit Edinburgh Castle, walk the Royal Mile, and hike up Arthur's Seat for panoramic views.

### Bath

This UNESCO World Heritage city is famous for its Roman baths and Georgian architecture. The natural hot springs have attracted visitors for over 2,000 years.

## Practical Tips

### Transportation

- Consider a BritRail pass if you're planning extensive train travel
- London's Oyster Card makes public transport easier and cheaper
- Driving is on the left side of the road

### Money Matters

## Cultural Considerations

The British are generally polite and reserved. Queue patiently, say please and thank you, and avoid loud conversations in public spaces. Pub culture is an important part of British life – it's a great way to meet locals and experience authentic culture.
