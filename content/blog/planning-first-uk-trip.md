# Planning Your First Trip to the UK: A Complete Guide

Planning your first trip to the UK can feel overwhelming with so many incredible destinations to choose from. This comprehensive guide will help you make the most of your visit.

## When to Visit

The UK can be visited year-round, but timing affects your experience:

### Peak Season (June-August)
- Warmest weather and longest days
- Major events and festivals
- Higher prices and larger crowds
- Book accommodations well in advance

### Shoulder Season (April-May, September-October)
- Mild weather and moderate crowds
- Better accommodation deals
- Beautiful spring flowers or autumn colors
- Our recommended time to visit!

### Low Season (November-March)
- Coldest and darkest months
- Lowest prices and smallest crowds
- Christmas markets and festive atmosphere
- Perfect for budget travelers

## How Long to Stay

We recommend at least 7-10 days for a first visit to experience the highlights without rushing:

- **7 days**: London and one other region
- **10 days**: London, Edinburgh, and countryside
- **14 days**: Comprehensive tour including multiple regions

## Must-Visit Destinations

### London (3-4 days)
Start in the capital to see iconic landmarks, world-class museums, and experience British culture at its most diverse.

### Edinburgh (2-3 days)
Scotland's capital offers historic charm, stunning architecture, and vibrant cultural scene.

### Cotswolds (2 days)
Picture-perfect villages with honey-colored stone cottages and rolling green hills.

### Bath (1-2 days)
Roman baths, Georgian architecture, and natural hot springs make Bath unique.

## Budgeting Your Trip

### Budget Range (per day per person)
- **Budget**: £50-80 (hostels, public transport, self-catering)
- **Mid-range**: £100-200 (hotels, mix of dining, some taxis)
- **Luxury**: £250+ (upscale hotels, fine dining, private tours)

### Money-Saving Tips
1. Use an Oyster card in London for transport
2. Visit free museums and galleries
3. Book advance train tickets for best prices
4. Stay in suburbs and take public transport
5. Have lunch as your main meal (cheaper than dinner)

## Transportation

### Getting Around
- **Train**: Fast and scenic, book in advance for deals
- **Bus**: Cheapest option for intercity travel
- **Car Rental**: Best for countryside exploration
- **Flights**: Quick for Scotland to London journeys

### Travel Passes
- BritRail Pass for unlimited train travel
- London Pass for attractions
- National Trust membership for historic sites

## Essential Tips

### 1. Weather Preparedness
Pack layers and always carry a compact umbrella. British weather is famously unpredictable!

### 2. Electrical Adapters
UK uses Type G plugs (three rectangular pins). Bring an adapter or buy one at the airport.

### 3. Tipping Etiquette
- Restaurants: 10-15% if service not included
- Taxis: Round up or 10%
- Pubs: Not expected

### 4. Opening Hours
Shops typically close by 6 PM (8 PM in cities). Sundays have reduced hours. Plan accordingly!

### 5. Booking Ahead
Reserve popular attractions, restaurants, and shows in advance, especially in peak season.
